		<p>Cats are very soft and fluffy animals. They have a tail and soft paws. They purr when feeling love and it is an amazing experience. Cats are very cute and just lovely animals.</p>

		<h2>They have...</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<img src="cat tail.jpg">
			<p><b>A tail</b> that stretches out from the end of their body. It is covered in hair just the same as their body. It is very flexible and they have many uses too.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="center">
			<img src="cat paws.jpg">
			<p><strong>Paws</strong> that look very soft; not only that they actually have extremely fluffy and soft surfaces underneath them. They also hide their claws in them. Paws are very important for cats.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="right">
			<img src="cat ears.jpg">
			<p><b>Their ears</b> add extra cuteness to them. They can hear very far away noises with them as they are very sharp. On the face of a single ear there is some hair that prevents from extra dust entering the cat's ears. They are also very soft and bendable.</p>
